			<h2>User Interviews</h2>
			
			<p>Through the user interviews I was able to really gain insight into the perspective of potential employers, friends, fellow prospects, etc. I hadn’t considered many things I had found through the user interviews. For example, the aesthetics of a website and personalization really mattered to those I interviewed. However I also should focus on content just as much.</p>
			
			<p>Another important thing I learned from the user interviews is actually, how not to do them. I realize I asked many not relevant questions during the interviews that weren’t beneficial to the problem at hand. Overall, I learned to ask more specific questions, and always ask questions in between the interview process as well.</p>

			<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
			
			<p>A competitor analysis allows me to identify those competitors in the same field as me with portfolios as well. I evaluated their strategies and how certain things worked for them or didn’t. Because I didn’t have much experience building websites I also used this to help me get a grasp of how to design my own website.</p>
			
			<p>I analyzed 3 different competitors.</p>
			
			<table border=0 class="rounded-list">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>I analyzed a fellow software developer, Neil. I reviewed this portfolio because I wanted to see an example of a website of someone in my current position.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>I analyzed another portfolio of a fellow developer and designer. Since Kalyn was also a designer I was able to view many deign aspects through this competitive analysis and see how those came into play when tying in also their coding abilities.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Lastly, I analyzed, LinkedIn. As a website that displays multiple people’s profiles, I saw LinkedIn as high competition. LinkedIn is used and trusted by many therefore I wanted to gain insight on how to convey that same trust and professionalism onto my own website.</p>
							</li>

			<table border=0 class="rounded-list">

					<td>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>Contact by Email: I included this because after the user interviews and competitive analysis, it became obvious it should always be included so that potential employers can always contact me.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Navigation Bar: A nav bar was necessary to help users navigate from one part of the website to another</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Introduction/Bio Section: It seemed imperative to include a short introductory paragraph to personalize the webpage.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Photo: An image of myself humanized the website and put a face onto the person being described.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Hobbies/Interests: This section was selected to be included in my website again to personalize the website and add my character. I wanted to feature parts of my life that make me who I am.  </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Experience Section: I thought it to be extremely important to include this so that employers are aware of my capabilities. Due to time constraints I have yet to add this page but plan to.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Projects/Personal Projects: I included personal projects as well as class ones also to show what i currently know how to do as well as what programs I am familiar with.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Relevant social media profiles: I feel it's important to include my professional LinkedIn account to show what connections I have already and then also included my gitHub so they can view my work with current projects.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Resume/Link to Resume: This was in my original plan however, from the presentations I learned that the resume's should not be linked do to information can be stolen.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Visual aspects to support some information: I made sure to include visual aspects throughout my entire website to support my content and not bore the viewer.</p>
							</li>

			<h2>Feature Prioritization</h2>
						
			<p>I prioritized the features based on the level of technical effort due to the fact that I was new to html/CSS. I started with what I knew and went on as I learned. Thus the lower technical effort features were prioritized.</p>

			<h2>User Stories</h2>
						
			<p>User stories allowed me to think in the perspective of different users. I was able to think the varying ways that people who visit my website are going to be thinking. I incorporated what I learned already about my users into these stories to assess what I know what the user wants and for what reasons. I tried to include the most important users, such as the hiring manager, recruiting company, and interviewer. </p>

			<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
						
			<p>A cognitive walkthrough is a one of many usability evaluation methods. It allows one to visually see exactly how a user goes through a series of tasks all while asking them why they choose to do certain things. Overall it is to gain insight into the perspective of the user. While conducting these interviews the challenges I faced was first if all scheduling these walkthroughs. One of mine was cancelled time, therefore this was my first challenge. </p>
			
			<p>Before the walkthrough I also had difficulty designing the question and tasks for it. I wasn’t aware what I wanted to ask the user. However, during the cognitive walkthrough, I was able to come up with questions on the spot to support my testing. I had no difficulties during the walkthrough and those went smoothly. The only concern I had was that I wasn’t documenting enough information down as the users performed tasks.</p>

			<h2>User Tests</h2>
						
			<p> The user tests I found to be the most helpful and intriguing. I conducted two types of tests; one was the click test and then the question tests. I choose them because I wanted to make sure that my navigation bar was working correctly and that the user can accurately identify the where certain information is. I had complications with my navigation bar so learned from the test to change it. I choose the question tests because I wanted to hear a broad answer from users. I wanted to ask general question about the main page because I felt uncertain about its structure, content, and general formatting. My test results for the question test revealed that I needed to add headings, which I am still working on implementing to the whole site. </p>

	<!-- SUMMARY OF FINDINGS CONTAINER -->
	<div class="header3">Summary of Findings</div>
	
	<section id = "project">
		<div class="container">
			<p>I was able to learn a lot from every part of user research and testing. I believe the research was really important. I had originally underestimated it, and not prepared well enough. I realized if I don’t prepare well with user research then user testing will be tougher. My research was lacking seeing as I don’t believe my user interview questions were as useful as they should’ve been. </p>
			
			<p>From the user interviews and the competitor analysis, I learned how to first of identify my user as well as incorporate that into the rest of the process. I really had to start considering how those I am competing with think. I had always known there are many other people also attempting to get the same jobs as me however I never realized the extent of it. I really researched many other portfolios to see how others incorporated a bit of themselves and personalized their websites. </p>
			
			<p>As a stakeholder to my own website the feature value matrix really allowed me to weigh the pros and cons of each individual feature I had wanted to incorporate. I realized some things I wanted to include just couldn’t or shouldn’t be included because the development effort would be too much for the scope of time I had. </p>
			<p>Overall I constantly learned to keep updating the website to suit the needs of my users, which ultimately benefit me. </p>

	<!-- INCORPORATION OF FINDINGS CONTAINER -->
	<div class="header3">Incorporation of Findings</div>
	
	<section id = "project">
		<div class="container">
			<p>From my findings, I decided to change a lot of things; many of which I did not get a chance to change. First of all, my original navigation bar glitches at times; there was complications with my old navigation bar; it would not center correctly and was working well in the mobile version therefore I replaced it with a simpler implementation of a navigation with bootstrap. Thus, I did make another one however I plan to modify it to fit in with the rest of the website. One user also suggested I create labels throughout to help them identify exactly what section of the website they are at. I have included it in most pages but working on having it everywhere. Another minor thing is the color scheme I am using, It was said in my cognitive walkthroughs that it was too bright, thus I will most likely be changing it to blue, which will portray more professionalism according to articles I have read. </p>
			
			<p>Next, some users expected the pictures to be clickable or have more detail, so I plan to either make them clickable or add a small description. For example, I will add a caption to the interests’ pictures to help distinguish what each picture means. Another thing I realized needs fixing is the placement of the technical skills. I plan to move them to the projects section and place them to what project I used or learned them at accordingly. </p>
			
			<p>It was suggested to me to include more projects as well to my projects page because it seemed empty, so I included a project I am currently working on and plan to add more past projects soon. Another change will be made in the contact page. I plan to drastically change that page, because it is very different from the rest of the website. It was said that it was out of place. From the in-class presentations I learned that I can also have the contact information constantly appear at the bottom as a footer, which is something I plan to do. I believe that will help keep my website consistent. Overall through my interviews, cognitive walkthrough etc. I realize my content is lacking, so I will be slowly adding more as I gain more experience. As well as I will continue to modify my content by providing more details with what I have now.
